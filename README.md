 SoC - System on a Chip (Circled Component)
 A chip is inside a package. It is connected to pins or inputs and outputs.Its major components are-
 Chip (IC): The core functional unit containing electronic circuits for processing and logic operations.
 
 Pads: Metallic contact points on the silicon die, ensuring electrical connectivity.

 Core: The processing unit within the chip, containing logic gates, memory, and computational elements.
 
 Die: A single slice of a silicon wafer that holds the semiconductor circuits.

 IPs (Intellectual Property blocks): Pre-designed functional modules like CPU cores, memory blocks, and communication interfaces (SPI, I2C, USB, etc.).

 What is QFN-48?
 
 The Quad Flat No-Lead (QFN-48) package is a compact, surface-mount IC package with 48 pins. It is widely used for microcontrollers, RF devices, and power management ICs due to its 
 excellent thermal dissipation, low electrical parasitics, and cost-effectiveness.

Advantages of QFN-48:
✔️ Small form factor, ideal for compact devices.

✔️ Enhanced thermal and electrical performance with exposed pad design.

✔️ Low parasitic inductance, suitable for high-speed applications.

✔️ Cost-effective and easy to manufacture.

Foundry : A semiconductor foundry is a company that manufactures chips on behalf of other companies, which may design the chips themselves but lack the facilities (fab) to actually produce them. Companies like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) and Samsung are prominent foundries. They take in designs (often developed by fabless companies) and fabricate the physical chips.

IP (Intellectual Property): In the context of semiconductors, IP refers to pre-designed and pre-verified blocks of logic or circuitry that can be used in creating a chip. Examples include processor cores, memory controllers, and various other functional blocks. Companies like ARM or Imagination Technologies provide IP that others integrate into their own custom chip designs.
