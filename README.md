 SoC - System on a Chip (Circled Component)
 A chip is inside a package. It is connected to pins or inputs and outputs.Its major components are-
 Chip (IC): The core functional unit containing electronic circuits for processing and logic operations.
 Pads: Metallic contact points on the silicon die, ensuring electrical connectivity.
 Core: The processing unit within the chip, containing logic gates, memory, and computational elements.
 Die: A single slice of a silicon wafer that holds the semiconductor circuits.
 IPs (Intellectual Property blocks): Pre-designed functional modules like CPU cores, memory blocks, and communication interfaces (SPI, I2C, USB, etc.).
